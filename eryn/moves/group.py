    """
    An abstract red-blue ensemble move with parallelization as described in
    `Foreman-Mackey et al. (2013) <https://arxiv.org/abs/1202.3665>`_.

    # TODO: think about this for reversible jump.

    Args:
        nfriends (int, optional): The number of sub-ensembles to use. Each
            sub-ensemble is updated in parallel using the other sets as the
            complementary ensemble. The default value is ``2`` and you
            probably won't need to change that.

        randomize_split (bool, optional): Randomly shuffle walkers between
            sub-ensembles. The same number of walkers will be assigned to
            each sub-ensemble on each iteration. By default, this is ``True``.

        live_dangerously (bool, optional): By default, an update will fail with
            a ``RuntimeError`` if the number of walkers is smaller than twice
            the dimension of the problem because the walkers would then be
            stuck on a low dimensional subspace. This can be avoided by
            switching between the stretch move and, for example, a
            Metropolis-Hastings step. If you want to do this and suppress the
            error, set ``live_dangerously = True``. Thanks goes (once again)
            to @dstndstn for this wonderful terminology.
        gibbs_sampling_leaves_per (int, optional): Number of individual leaves
            to sample over during Gibbs Sampling. ``None`` means there will be
            no Gibbs sampling. Currently, if you specify anything other than ``None``,
            it will split up different branches automatically and then Gibbs sample
            over each branch indivudally. Default is ``None``.

    ``kwargs`` are passed to :class:`Move` class.
